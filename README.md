# Mario-in-a-Misfit-World
Mario Kart in Pac-Man's universe

The Pac-Man game code was created by the programmer at https://pacmancode.com/. The code files here contain modifications to the sprite sheet and the pacman.py file. 
This game is a combination of Mario Kart and Pac-Man to showcase disability in the built world. It is shows the difficulty Mario has in moving around Pac-Man's world, a world not built for him. 
This game runs on Python 3 and was done in collaboration with a classmate for their ENG198 final project.
